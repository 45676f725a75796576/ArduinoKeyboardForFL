# Simple Arduino Synthesizer

This project uses code from user [chariscat](https://projecthub.arduino.cc/chariscat/building-the-auduino-synthesiser-arduino-based-diy-synth-7b8545)

For this project I made box and some edit in code to delete some unnecessary features.

## Setup

For synthesizer you will need:
- Arduino Uno
- 5 potentiometers
- Speaker
- Jump cambles

1. Install code into your Arduino.
2. Print box (optional)
3. Install everything as in schematic.
